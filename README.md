<h1 align="center">React Task List</h1>
<p align="center">This is my first React app, I wanted to do a simple task list application</p>
<br/>
<h2>Info</h2>
<p>I wanted to do this all by my own and only using react, I could've used Redux for the global state and Material UI to simplify the style but since this was my first touch with react I wanted to be as "pure" as I can.</p>
